from kivy.uix.label import Label

class Lbl(App):

'[color=color_code]text[/color]'

We shouldn't use space between markup text and value. [color = ff0000] will not work while [color=ff0033] will work.


- What is sp in font size?

sp is Scale-Independent pixel. Here sp scale factor depends on a user settings. If you are familiar with dp then keep in mind sp = dp * scale.

The dp has constant ratio transition to px: dp = px * ratio. Where ratio will never change on any particular device.

While sp (s for scaled) has scalable ratio: sp = px * ratio * scale. Where ratio never changes, but scale is user configurable. This scale can be used by people who need larger font sizes, for example, to use device more comfortably.
